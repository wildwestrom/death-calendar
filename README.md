# Death Calendar

Ever wonder how many days you have left to live?  
Death Calendar can show you at a glance.

The main feature is its SVG calendar generator. It's meant to be used as a reminder of your mortality, so that you can make the most of your limited time on Earth.

This was 100% inspired by the [waitbutwhy.com](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) article, visualizing human life using various charts.

## Installation

Make sure you have a working rust toolchain.

```shell

cargo install
```
